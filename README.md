# Hi, I'm Rocco

I'm a developer focused on building **simple and useful tools** for real problems.  
I care about clarity, practicality, and solutions that age well.

Good engineering shouldn't be loud or complicated — it should just work.

---

## What I Build

I focus on tools that:

- solve a concrete pain  
- reduce friction for developers  
- prefer simplicity over cleverness  
- are easy to understand, use, and maintain  

I'm not trying to reinvent the ecosystem.  
I'm trying to make the everyday work **lighter and cleaner**.

---

## Philosophy

I believe in:

- solving what matters  
- choosing the simplest approach  
- keeping code readable and honest  
- building with intention  
- shipping with consistency  

Complexity is easy.  
Simplicity takes work — and that's exactly where I put my effort.

## What I'm Exploring

- Performance patterns in modern frontend stacks  
- Lightweight development workflows  
- Small tools with big impact  
- Perceptual simplicity in engineering  
- Clear and quiet interfaces  

---

## How I Work

I prefer:

- directness over decoration  
- clarity over perfectionism  
- small sharp tools over large abstract ones  
- building → testing → refining  
- letting the work speak for itself

### Thanks for stopping by.

I’ll keep building — slowly, intentionally, and always with purpose.
